New for me:
- trailing spaces on the end of properties file are not trimmed
- resource bundle can be Java files
- priority when looking for bundle files is:
  - java - requested locale
  - properties - requested locale
  - java - requested locale without country
  - properties - requested locale country
  - java - default locale
  - properties - default locale
  - java - default locale without country
  - properties - default locale country
  - java - without locale
  - properties - without locale
  - MissingResourceException
- keys are searched in all files not as above! When requested local is found, then default locale is ignored!
- when java parses string against numbers it ignores not recognized elements, i.e. characters, so "456abc" -> 456
